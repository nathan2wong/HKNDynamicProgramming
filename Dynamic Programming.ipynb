    "Dynamic Programming is a method we can use for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into simpler smaller problems, solving each of those subproblems, and storing their solutions so we can reference them later. For example, we could use dynamic programming to find the longest substrings in common between two words, assuming we can skip over some letters. To get started on understanding dynamic programming, let's explore the basics of a fundamental part: recursion!"

    "Recursion is a tool used to solve a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem, as described above. In essence, a recursive function is any function that we define in terms of itself. We can understand recursion from the common example of summing the first n whole numbers, shown below."

    "Even though we havenâ€™t finished defining sum_recursive when we make our recursive call in the final line, we are still able to call it since the function body is not evaluated until the function is called. When n is 0, we just return n. This is known as the base case, and it allows the recursive function to halt at some point. Given that this base case works, we can compute sum_recursive(1) in terms of sum_recursive(0), sum_recursive(2) in terms of sum_recursive(1), and so on."
